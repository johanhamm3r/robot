# INSTRUCTIONS

THE 2 ROBOTS ARE SEPERATED INTO 2 JS FILES

TO TEST THE ROBOTS
1. AT THE BOTTOM OF EACH FILE THERE ARE SOME PARAMS WHICH CAN BE ADJUSTED. SUCH AS
- Command. Where to drive
- Start location
- Start direction (north for example)

2. Open a terminal and type "node x.js" 
replace the "x" with the name of the file


The circle room is based on the CARTESIAN COORDINATE SYSTEM. The result will be different from instructions due to this. I think this is a more appropriate solution
